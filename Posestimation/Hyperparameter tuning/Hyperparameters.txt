1) min_detection_confidence
	* Planned to go from .5 to .7
	* Higher the value, detection sensitivity is lower and false positive rate is lower

2) min_tracking_confidence 
	* higher values will result more reliable hand landmarks but with a potential of stop tracking when jittery and unclear 
	* 0.5 to 1 planned range

3) model_complexity
	* 0, 1 (default), 2
	* planned to use 1 and 2
	* Higher the value - more complex accurate and much slower

4) static_image_mode
	* True is selected for this evaluation
	* False - Suitable for real time stream, model will try to track movement over multiple frames

5) max_num_hands
	* 1 (for this dataset evaluation)
